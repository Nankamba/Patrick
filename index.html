            <p>
            You are smart, intelligent, focused, humble, kind, cool and very funny but what stands out the most about you to me is your loyalty.
            </p>
            <p>Your loyalty is like that of a dog. It is reckless and amazing at the same time. 
             This reminds of the creators love which never gives up on me.
            It is not a weakness rather it is strength which in some ways gives us a glimpse of the character of Yahweh.
             When we are not faithful He remains faithful because He does not change who He is. The world needs loyalty like yours Patrick.
            I know I do.Through you I have now known what friendship means. Thanks a million for not giving up on me! </p>

        <p>
        As you turn 31 today, I wish to congratulate you for staying true to yourself. I know It has not been easy.
        I have seen you fall and rise up with grace. I have seen you fail and excel. But one thing remains you have not given up. Which makes you a
        true champion worth emulating.
        you have remained tenacious in all circumstances even when all odds were against you. In the end all things worked out 
        together for your good and everyone of us because of your love for God. 
        </p>
       <p>
        You may not be were you want to be but I know you have left.This brings me excitement and I look forward
        to see all that God has packaged in you. As you achieve your life goals one step at a time.
        Unwrapping all that is within you and transition into the man you were created to be.
        I wish you the very best today and forevermore. 
       </p>
